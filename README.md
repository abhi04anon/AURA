# 🌐 AURA — Automated Unified Risk Assessment

**AURA** is a Python-based, command-line tool for **web security reconnaissance** and **lightweight vulnerability scanning**.  
It is designed to help security researchers, penetration testers, and system administrators **map, analyze, and report on web applications** in a structured and extensible way.

⚠️ **Legal Disclaimer**  
This tool is provided for **educational and authorized security testing purposes only**.  
Do **not** use AURA against systems you do not own or explicitly have permission to test. Unauthorized usage is illegal and unethical.
